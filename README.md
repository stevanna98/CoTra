# CoTra
## Project realized by a team of students from Politecnico di Milano

### Author: Giulia Carpani, Filippo Castellani, Orith Halfon, Stefano Vannoni, Elisabetta Marini



## What does it do ?
Our skill implements a digital version of the [Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test][1].

## Scope: 
This skill was created for [Alexa][2] devices, leveraging the powerful framework of [Alexa Skill Kit][3].

## What software does it require ?
 - No software is required to run this. It is sufficient to upload the files on the [Alexa Developer Console][4] (ADC) after creating your own account.
 - A **very important step**: you need to provide the permissions indicated in the paragraph down below for a proper use of the skill with all its functionalities.

## Example scenario:
By cloning this repository and uploading it on the [ADC][4] you will be able to launch the skill by saying:

"_Alexa Launch CoTra Skill_".

## Configuration of Permissions
1. Provide permission on the ADC.
